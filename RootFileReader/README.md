Reason for choosing C# MVC

Basic Structure 
-Runs on Visual Studio Code and IIS Express
-SQL Avoidance
	-Thats why there is more logic in the controller.
-Why much of the MS framework remains
-Why a list of models
-Why 3 lists (name of drivers, driver list, sorted driver list)

Test Strategy
-Both to test completed code and to test components as built
-Test every method
-Test every derived property in model
